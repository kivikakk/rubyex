RubyEx Bytecode Design
======================

    class Frank
      def initialize(name)
        puts "Hi #{name}."
      end

      def kill
        puts "I'm dead!"
      end
    end

    def do_it name
      f = Frank.new "Equinox"
      f.kill
      puts " -- #{name}"
    end

    do_it (rabid = "Forethought")

Now, we're tasked with converting this into bytecode. How do we handle the creation of classes, for instance? Or defining functions? We need to be aware of our "context", which is this strange `main' Object.
