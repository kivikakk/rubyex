Now that we have some form of `eval', work on implementing `irb' in the subset of Ruby that rx understands.
That'll require stdio, function definitions for sure (more control structures?), and ultimately _blocks_.
We have closures now, though, so it should be a piece of cake.

This is also a TODO bug:
celtic@sohma:~/git/rubyex/ruby master$ ./ruby -irb
Binding()
rxi(main):001:0> 3; 2
=> 2
rxi(main):002:0> a = Class.new.new; 3
=> 3
rxi(main):003:0> p a
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
