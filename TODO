Game plan:
 * require
 * optional arguments
 * IO
 * regexps -- oniguruma
 * attr_*
 * *_eval
 * MRI compatibility layer

Shorter term problems:
 * catch/throw
 * Float range is small
 * RubyClass::new_instance(): these should not be centralised
 * assignments should always return rvalue
 * Fixnum, Symbol don't have instance variables
 * flex encounters push-black overflows due to brace nesting occasionally
 * Module::method syntax
 * '`' method impossible to declare due to lexer switching modes
 * Dir::glob needs to work to MRI's wildcard syntax
 * and/&&, or/|| need to not evaulate second condition if first fails/succeeds
 * `p 1 and 2' should parse to `(p 1) and 2'
