Game plan:
 * optional arguments
 * IO
 * require
 * catch/throw (not keywords)
 * attr_*
 * *_eval
 * regexps -- oniguruma

Not as important right now:
 * our float range sucks (double). Fix.
 * investigate strange issue with Array.new(int)
 * better solution for new_instance() in rclass
 * methods ending in `=' should always return the RHS
 * all RubyValues need instance variables.
 * sometimes flex encounters a push-back overflow due to braces (blocks)
 * Kernel::method() needs to work
 * even though '`' is in the function_name rule, it'll never be sent to the parser. (lexer starts interpreting already.)
 * ``1==2? a : b'' is resolving to ``1==(2 ? a : b)''
 * Dir::glob only works with glob(3)'s syntax, not MRI's (e.g. `**', flags.)
