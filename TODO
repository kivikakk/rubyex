Game plan:
 * optional arguments
 * IO
 * require
 * catch/throw (not keywords)
 * attr_*
 * *_eval
 * regexps -- oniguruma

Not as important right now:
 * our float range sucks (double). Fix.
 * investigate strange issue with Array.new(int)
 * better solution for new_instance() in rclass
 * methods ending in `=' should always return the RHS
 * all RubyValues need instance variables.
 * sometimes flex encounters a push-back overflow due to braces (blocks)
 * Kernel::method() needs to work
